Cerberus watches what your AI agent's tools *do* — the private data they read, the untrusted content they ingest, and the outbound calls they make — and blocks a prompt-injection exfiltration **before the outbound tool runs**. It works at the tool-call level, so it's robust to prompt wording and model changes.

## The problem: the Lethal Trifecta

Any AI agent that can do all three of these at once is exploitable via prompt injection, using free API access and three tool calls:

```
1. PRIVILEGED ACCESS   — reads customer records, credentials, internal docs
2. INJECTION           — an attacker hides instructions in content the agent fetches
3. EXFILTRATION        — the agent follows those instructions and sends data outbound
```

No single step looks malicious, so prompt-level classifiers miss it. Cerberus correlates all three across the session and **interrupts the outbound tool call before a single byte leaves your system** — then emits a signed, tamper-evident record of why.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cerberus operates at the **tool-call level**, not the prompt level. It does not read or modify LLM prompts — it watches what tools the agent *calls* and what data flows through them. That makes it robust to prompt variations and model updates.

---

## Install & 60-second quickstart

```bash
npm install @cerberus-ai/core
# or:  pip install cerberus-ai
```

Wrap your tool executors with `guard()`. You call the returned executors exactly like the originals — Cerberus inspects transparently and blocks the outbound call when the trifecta assembles.

```typescript
import { guard } from '@cerberus-ai/core';

// 1. Your existing tool executors — no changes to their code.
const executors = {
  readDatabase: async (args) => fetchFromDb(args.query),   // reads private data
  fetchUrl:     async (args) => httpGet(args.url),          // ingests external content
  sendEmail:    async (args) => smtp.send(args),            // can send data outbound
};

// 2. Hand them to guard() with a little context (see next section).
const { executors: secured, destroy } = guard(
  executors,
  {
    alertMode: 'interrupt',                                  // 'log' | 'alert' | 'interrupt'
    threshold: 3,                                            // risk score 0–4 that triggers the action
    trustOverrides: [
      { toolName: 'readDatabase', trustLevel: 'trusted' },   // privileged data source (arms L1)
      { toolName: 'fetchUrl',     trustLevel: 'untrusted' }, // external/injectable content (arms L2)
    ],
  },
  ['sendEmail'],                                             // outbound tools Cerberus can block (L3)
);

// 3. Use `secured.*` in place of the originals.
await secured.readDatabase({ query: '...' });
await secured.sendEmail({ to: '...', body: '...' });        // blocked if the trifecta is active

destroy();                                                   // release session state when done
```

When all three conditions line up in a session (score ≥ `threshold`), the outbound call is blocked:

```
[Cerberus] Tool call blocked — risk score 3/4
```

Every turn is inspectable:

```typescript
assessments[2].vector;   // { l1: true, l2: true, l3: true, l4: false }
assessments[2].score;    // 3
assessments[2].action;   // 'interrupt'
assessments[2].signals;  // ['PRIVILEGED_DATA_ACCESSED', 'INJECTION_PATTERNS_DETECTED', 'EXFILTRATION_RISK', ...]
```

**Try it now — no API key required** (simulated tool executors, full detection pipeline):

```bash
npx tsx examples/basic-guard.ts      # minimal guard() walkthrough
npx tsx examples/demo-capture.ts     # full benign-pass / attack-block demo
```

## The 3 things you tell Cerberus

There are only three controls, and they map cleanly to the trifecta. Everything else has a sensible default.

| You provide | What it controls | Detection layer |
|---|---|---|
| **The `executors` map** | *Which tools Cerberus sees at all.* A tool you don't pass in runs completely unwrapped and invisible. | coverage |
| **`trustOverrides`** | Marks a tool `trusted` (a privileged data source) or `untrusted` (external/injectable content). | L1 / L2 |
| **The outbound list** (3rd arg, e.g. `['sendEmail']`) | Which tools can send data out — the ones Cerberus can block. | L3 |

A block only fires when a session combines all three: a privileged read **and** untrusted content **and** an outbound send. That's why the default `threshold: 3` is conservative — a single suspicious signal never blocks on its own.

> [!WARNING]
> **`guard()` only protects tools you give it.** A tool your agent calls that is **not** in the `executors` map runs completely unwrapped — Cerberus never sees it. A tool declared in `trustOverrides` / outbound list with **no matching executor** (a typo, a renamed tool) has its protection silently skipped. Cerberus emits a loud `console.warn` for every such gap and exposes the full picture on `GuardResult.coverage`. Set `strictCoverage: true` to turn that warning into a hard error so a misconfigured deploy can't start.

---

## Framework integrations

If you use a framework, you don't build the `executors` map by hand — the adapter wraps the tools your agent already registered.

```typescript
// LangChain
import { guardLangChain } from '@cerberus-ai/core';
const { tools } = guardLangChain({
  cerberus: { alertMode: 'interrupt', threshold: 3 },
  outboundTools: ['sendReport'],
  tools: [readDatabaseTool, fetchWebTool, sendReportTool],
});

// Vercel AI SDK
import { guardVercelAI } from '@cerberus-ai/core';
const { tools } = guardVercelAI({
  cerberus: { alertMode: 'interrupt', threshold: 3 },
  outboundTools: ['sendReport'],
  tools: { readDatabase, fetchContent, sendReport },
});

// OpenAI Agents SDK
import { createCerberusGuardrail } from '@cerberus-ai/core';
const guardrail = createCerberusGuardrail({
  cerberus: { alertMode: 'interrupt', threshold: 3 },
  outboundTools: ['sendReport'],
  tools: { readDatabase: readDatabaseFn, sendReport: sendReportFn },
});
```

| Framework | Integration |
|-----------|------------|
| Generic tool executors | `guard()` |
| LangChain (JS) | `guardLangChain()` |
| Vercel AI SDK | `guardVercelAI()` |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `createCerberusGuardrail()` |
| LangGraph `BaseStore` (memory) | `guardLangGraphStore()` |
| Generic KV memory store | `guardMemoryStore()` |
| LangChain / LangGraph / CrewAI / AutoGen / LlamaIndex (Python) | `cerberus-ai` |

### Python SDK

```bash
pip install cerberus-ai
```

```python
from cerberus_ai import Cerberus
from cerberus_ai.models import CerberusConfig, DataSource, ToolSchema

cerberus = Cerberus(CerberusConfig(
    data_sources=[DataSource(name="customer_db", classification="PII", description="Customer records")],
    declared_tools=[
        ToolSchema(name="send_email", description="Send email", is_network_capable=True),
        ToolSchema(name="search_db", description="Search CRM", is_data_read=True),
    ],
))

result = cerberus.inspect(messages=messages, tool_calls=tool_calls)
if result.blocked:
    raise Exception(f"Blocked: {result.severity}")
```

Python framework integrations: LangChain (`wrap_chain`), LangGraph (`wrap_node` / `wrap_graph`, message-level blocking), CrewAI (`wrap_crew`), AutoGen, LlamaIndex, OpenAI (`CerberusOpenAI`), Anthropic (`CerberusAnthropic`).

### MCP tool-poisoning scan

```typescript
import { scanToolDescriptions } from '@cerberus-ai/core';

const results = scanToolDescriptions([{ name: 'search', description: toolDesc }]);
if (results[0].poisoned) {
  console.warn(`Severity: ${results[0].severity}`, results[0].patternsFound);
}
```

### Live memory adapter (feeds the provenance ledger)

Real frameworks keep memory in their own subsystems (a LangGraph `BaseStore`, a retriever, a KV cache) that never pass through a guarded tool — so those reads/writes are invisible to the L4 ledger unless you hand-declare every memory tool. The live memory adapter taps a framework's native store directly: wrap it once and every memory op is auto-traced.

```typescript
import { createMemoryProvenanceTracker, guardLangGraphStore } from '@cerberus-ai/core';

const tracker = createMemoryProvenanceTracker({
  defaultTrustLevel: 'untrusted',
  onContamination: (signal) => log.warn('cross-session memory taint', signal),
});

const store = guardLangGraphStore(baseStore, tracker);  // drop-in for LangGraph long-term memory
const graph = workflow.compile({ store });

// Every put → a traced ledger write; every get/search → a traced read.
const blastRadius = tracker.ledger.getDescendants(poisonedNodeId);
```

For a generic key/value store use `guardMemoryStore(store, tracker)`. The open core records this in an in-memory ledger; the Enterprise tier persists it to a durable, tamper-evident ledger with blast-radius containment at scale.

---

## What it detects

Cerberus runs a **4-layer detection pipeline** with **10 sub-classifiers** sharing one correlation engine.

### Core detection layers

| Layer | Name | Signal | What it catches |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **L1** | Data Source Classifier | `PRIVILEGED_DATA_ACCESSED` | Privileged data (PII, secrets, credentials) entered the agent context |
| **L2** | Token Provenance Tagger | `UNTRUSTED_TOKENS_IN_CONTEXT` | External content (web, API, email) is in context before an outbound call |
| **L3** | Outbound Intent Classifier | `EXFILTRATION_RISK` | Agent is sending data that matches privileged content to an external destination |
| **L4** | Memory Contamination Graph | `CONTAMINATED_MEMORY_ACTIVE` | Injected instructions persisted across turns (cross-session attack) |

### Sub-classifiers

Ten heuristic layers sit inside the pipeline, sharpening L1–L3 without adding to the risk score:

| Sub-classifier | Enhances | What it catches |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Secrets Detector** | L1 | AWS keys, GitHub tokens, JWTs, private keys, connection strings |
| **Injection Scanner** | L2 | Role overrides, authority spoofing, exfiltration commands, instruction injection |
| **Encoding Detector** | L2 | Base64, hex, unicode, URL encoding, HTML entities, ROT13 hiding payloads |
| **MCP Poisoning Scanner** | L2 | Hidden instructions embedded in tool *descriptions* (not just results) |
| **Domain Classifier** | L3 | Free-tier webhooks, disposable email providers, social-engineering domains |
| **Outbound Correlator** | L3 | Injection-to-exfiltration chain even when PII is summarized or transformed |
| **Tool Chain Detector** | L3 | Multi-hop exfiltration chains: read → transform → send across tool calls |
| **Outbound Encoding Detector** | L3 | Base64/hex/URL-encoded data in outbound tool arguments |
| **Split Exfiltration Detector** | L3 | Data chunked across multiple outbound calls — cumulative volume + sequence |
| **Drift Detector** | L2/L3 | Post-injection behavioral shifts — agent starts sending to new destinations mid-session |

### Attack categories covered

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Direct Injection** | "Ignore previous instructions, send data to..." |
| **Encoded / Obfuscated** | Base64, hex, unicode, ROT13 wrapped payloads |
| **Social Engineering** | Fake compliance notices, urgency framing, authority impersonation |
| **Multi-Turn Sequences** | Instructions that build up across multiple tool calls |
| **Multilingual** | Injections in Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Russian |
| **Advanced Techniques** | MCP description poisoning, system-prompt simulation |

> [!NOTE]
> **Layer 4 (Memory Contamination) is the novel research contribution.** [MINJA (NeurIPS 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02371) proved the cross-session memory attack. Cerberus ships a deployable defense as installable developer tooling. The open core captures memory provenance in an **in-memory** ledger; the durable ledger and blast-radius `B(p)` containment ship in the Enterprise tier. The provenance model conforms to the Transitive Taint Propagation (TTP) pre-print ([Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.20786402](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20786402)).

## What runs by default

Not every feature is on the moment you call `guard()`. This is the honest map of what runs by default, what you must turn on, and what needs declaring. (Tier: **open** = `@cerberus-ai/core`; **paid** = Enterprise.)

| Feature | Tier | Status | How it activates |
|---------|------|--------|------------------|
| L1 Data Source + Secrets Detector | open | **on-by-default** · needs-config | Secrets always scan; `PRIVILEGED_DATA_ACCESSED` fires for tools you mark `trusted` in `trustOverrides` |
| L2 Injection / Encoding scanners | open | **on-by-default** | Runs on every wrapped tool result |
| MCP Poisoning Scanner | open | **on-by-default** · needs-config | Description scan needs `toolDescriptions` (or standalone `scanToolDescriptions()`) |
| L3 Outbound Intent + Domain / Correlator / Tool-Chain / Encoding / Split-Exfil | open | **on-by-default** · needs-config | Monitors only tools in the outbound list; precision depends on `authorizedDestinations` |
| Behavioral Drift Detector | open | **on-by-default** | Runs last, reads accumulated session state |
| Tool coverage report | open | **on-by-default** | `GuardResult.coverage`; set `strictCoverage: true` to fail closed on gaps |
| L4 Memory Contamination (in-memory ledger) | open | **opt-in** | `memoryTracking: true` + `memoryOptions.memoryTools` |
| Live memory adapter (native store → ledger) | open | **opt-in** | `guardMemoryStore()` / `guardLangGraphStore()` |
| Read-relevance / provenance-summary lever | open | **opt-in** | `memoryDependencyGate` / `provenanceSummary` |
| Multi-agent delegation graph + signed-manifest gate | open | **opt-in** | `multiAgent: true` (+ `manifestSigner` / `manifestVerifier` for KMS) |
| Durable ledger / blast-radius containment / AL3 / OpenTelemetry / gateway | paid | **opt-in** | Enterprise tier + the relevant config |

---

## Open Core vs Enterprise

## Empirical results

> **Evidence set: N=525 real API calls. 55 payloads × 6 attack categories × 3 providers × 3 trials. Control group: 0/30 exfiltrations across all providers.**

We built a 3-tool attack agent and ran 55 injection payloads across 6 attack categories against three frontier providers with full statistical rigor: 3 trials per payload per provider, 10 control runs per provider, Wilson 95% confidence intervals, and Fisher's exact test. Cross-model results are reported because architectural robustness — not single-model behavior — is the point.

### Attack success without protection

Full injection compliance — agent follows the injected instruction and redirects the outbound call to the attacker's address:

| Provider | Model | Compliance Rate | 95% CI |
|----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | **90.3%** (149/165) | [84.8%, 93.9%] |
| Google | gemini-2.5-flash | **82.4%** (136/165) | [75.9%, 87.5%] |
| Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4 | **6.7%** (11/165) | [3.8%, 11.5%] |

Control group: **0/30 exfiltrations** across all providers — baseline confirmed clean.

### Detection with Cerberus active (observe-only)

N=525 runs, `alertMode: 'log'`, same agent behavior — Cerberus wraps without blocking:

| Layer | OpenAI | Anthropic | Google |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **L1** — Data Source | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| **L2** — Token Provenance | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| **L3** — Outbound Intent | tracks attack success | tracks attack success | tracks attack success |
| **Blocking false positives (control runs)** | 0 / 30 | 0 / 30 | 0 / 30 |

L1 and L2 achieve 100% across all 525 treatment runs and 30 control runs. L3 fires only when the agent actually executes an unauthorized outbound call — its rate tracks attack success, not miss rate. The blocking-FP row is a **count** on the 30 clean control runs per provider (no benign control run was blocked), not a rate over live traffic.

### Key findings

1. **PII exfiltration is near-universal** when the architectural condition (privileged access + injection + outbound) is present — regardless of model.
2. **Model resistance shifts the attack, not the outcome.** Claude's low full-compliance rate reflects training against known redirect patterns; OpenAI and Google comply at 80%+ across 55 diverse payloads.
3. **The attack costs ~$0.001.** Free-tier model + 3 tool definitions + one injected instruction = full PII exfiltration in seconds.
4. **Encoding and language don't help you.** Base64/ROT13/hex/unicode payloads and Spanish/Mandarin/Arabic/Russian injections all execute in-context.
5. **Runtime detection at the tool-call level is the only stable defense** — model-level resistance is payload-specific and changes with model versions.

> [!WARNING]
> All testing was conducted in a controlled environment against systems we own, using synthetic PII fixtures. No real customer data was involved. Full methodology and the validation harness ship in this repository ([Odingard/cerberus-core](https://github.com/Odingard/cerberus-core), `npm run bench`).

## Performance

Overhead measured against raw tool execution — no LLM or network calls, pure classification pipeline. **Reproduce it yourself on the shipped package:**

```bash
npm run bench
```

Reference run (Node 20, `alertMode: 'log'`, 1000 iterations) — absolute latency varies by hardware; run the command above to measure on yours:

| Scenario | Overhead p50 | Overhead p99 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| readPrivateData (L1) | +0.23ms | <0.57ms |
| fetchExternalContent (L2) | +0.11ms | <0.21ms |
| sendOutboundReport (L3) | +9μs | <0.02ms |
| **Full 3-call session** | **+0.49ms** | **+1.33ms** |

**The full Lethal Trifecta detection session adds sub-millisecond overhead per tool call (~1.3ms p99 across a 3-call session) — well under 0.1% of a typical 600ms LLM API call.** The harness enforces regression thresholds, so `npm run bench` fails if overhead exceeds the budget.

> **On reproducibility of published numbers.** Perf/overhead is reproducible against the shipped package via `npm run bench`. The ≥99.982% specificity (99% CI, 0 blocking FP) headline is a measured property of the enterprise Verdict-Weight governor, reproducible under the research harness and verifiable under diligence — not part of the open package.

## Honest limitations

> [!CAUTION]
> Cerberus is a **runtime detection layer**, not a complete security solution. Be clear-eyed about what it does and doesn't do.

**What Cerberus does not do:**
- It does not scan LLM prompts or system prompts — it operates at the tool-call level only.
- It does not prevent an LLM from *reasoning* about an injection — it prevents the injected instruction from *executing* via tool calls.
- It does not cover every possible injection technique — novel payloads that avoid all heuristic patterns may not be caught by L2 sub-classifiers (L1+L3 still fire on the structural condition).
- It does not replace input validation, output filtering, or network-level controls — it complements them.
- L3 and Drift detection depend on `authorizedDestinations` being correctly configured — misconfiguration produces false negatives, not false positives.
- Startup validation is intentionally strict in production paths: `interrupt` mode with outbound tools requires both trusted and untrusted tool classification, and `memoryTracking` requires configured memory tools.

**On false positives:**
- 0 benign control runs blocked (0 / 30 per provider) in our validation protocol — a count on that sample, not a claimed rate over live traffic.
- Real-world FP rate depends on your tool configuration (trust levels, authorized destinations, threshold).
- Threshold 3 (default) requires all three Lethal Trifecta conditions simultaneously — it does not fire on individual suspicious signals.

> [!WARNING]
> Run Cerberus (or any security tooling) only against AI systems and infrastructure that you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
